# Online Shopping Cart (Python OOP Project)

This project is a **console-based Shopping Cart system** implemented using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Python. It simulates a basic e-commerce shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, add them to a cart, modify cart contents, and checkout — all from the terminal.

- Understanding **encapsulation, data hiding**, and **method overloading**
- Writing clean and modular code using **OOP best practices**
- Handling **real-world scenarios** like inventory management
- Practicing **input validation** and **CLI interaction**
- Preparing for **Python mini-projects**, **internships**, or **university assignments**
